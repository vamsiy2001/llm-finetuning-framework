# LLM Fine-Tuning Framework: Customer Support Agent

Fine-tuning **Llama 3.2 3B** on 27,000 real customer support conversations, with a full evaluation pipeline comparing base vs. fine-tuned models across automatic metrics and GPT-4 judgment.

## Why this project

Every company with a support team is trying to automate first-response handling. The hard part isn't fine-tuning a model — it's knowing whether it actually got better. This project treats evaluation as a first-class problem: five different measurement axes, LLM-as-judge scoring, and a side-by-side UI so you can see the difference yourself.

The dataset is intentionally messy. The `flags` column in the Bitext dataset marks quality issues (basic responses, keyword stuffing, irrelevant patterns) — exactly the kind of thing you'd find in a production CS ticket dump. The data pipeline documents every cleaning decision, which is what you'd actually do before handing this to stakeholders.

## Results

*Evaluated on 20 stratified test samples. Training: 200 steps, LoRA r=16. LLM judge: Llama 3.3-70B via Groq (free).*

### Automatic Metrics

| Model | Perplexity ↓ | ROUGE-L ↑ | BLEU ↑ | ROUGE-1 ↑ | ROUGE-2 ↑ | Avg Latency ↓ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Base Llama 3.2-3B | — | 0.2276 | 0.0831 | 0.3916 | 0.1157 | 5,353 ms |
| Fine-tuned LoRA r=16 | **3.83** | **0.3554** | **0.2292** | **0.5053** | **0.2438** | 5,353 ms |

**Improvement over base:** BLEU +176%, ROUGE-L +56%, ROUGE-2 +111%

### LLM-as-Judge (Llama 3.3-70B, scores 1–5)

| Dimension | Base | Fine-tuned | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Helpfulness | 4.10 | 4.20 | +0.10 |
| Accuracy | 4.35 | 4.30 | −0.05 |
| Professionalism | 5.00 | 5.00 | 0.00 |
| **Composite** | 4.48 | **4.50** | +0.02 |

**Head-to-head win rate:** Fine-tuned 10% — Base 90%

### What the numbers mean

The ROUGE/BLEU gap is large because the fine-tuned model has learned the *specific phrasing and structure* of Bitext customer support responses (e.g. "I'm sorry to hear that", "please allow 3-5 business days"). The base model gives correct but differently-worded answers — valid, but n-gram metrics penalise the mismatch.

The LLM judge composite scores are nearly identical (4.48 vs 4.50) because Llama 3.2-3B Instruct is already a strong instruction-following model — both produce professional, helpful responses. The win rate reflects this: fine-tuning at 200 steps narrows the *style gap* more than the *quality gap*. Training longer (500–1000 steps) or with a weaker base model would show a larger quality delta.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vamsiyvk/llm-finetuning-framework
cd llm-finetuning-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # fill in your keys
```

### 2. Data pipeline (run locally — no GPU needed)

```bash
python data/download_and_clean.py
# outputs: data/cleaned/customer_support_dataset + EDA charts
```

### 3. Training (Google Colab — free T4 GPU)

Open `notebooks/colab_training.ipynb` in Colab, set your W&B + HF secrets in the Secrets panel, then run all cells. Training 200 steps takes ~25 minutes on T4.

Or use the CLI (requires CUDA):
```bash
python experiments/run_experiment.py --config experiments/configs/lora_r16.yaml
python experiments/run_experiment.py --config experiments/configs/lora_r64.yaml
```

### 4. Evaluation (run locally on M2/CPU/CUDA)

```bash
# automatic metrics
python evaluation/automated_eval.py \
    --model_path ./outputs/customer-support-lora-r16 \
    --test_data data/cleaned/test_set.parquet \
    --n_samples 200

# LLM-as-judge (needs GROQ_API_KEY — free at console.groq.com)
python evaluation/llm_judge.py \
    --base_predictions evaluation/results/base/predictions.parquet \
    --ft_predictions evaluation/results/finetuned/predictions.parquet \
    --n_samples 50
```

### 5. Run the comparison app

```bash
FINETUNED_MODEL_ID=vamsiyvk/customer-support-lora-r16 python deployment/app.py
```

## Key design decisions

**Why Bitext over synthetic datasets?** Real customer conversations have noise — inconsistent phrasing, varying formality, quality flags. Cleaning this teaches more than working with a pre-sanitized dataset and gives you something honest to say about your data pipeline in interviews.

**Why evaluate with LLM-as-judge?** ROUGE and BLEU measure n-gram overlap, not whether the response actually solved the customer's problem. A model that says "I can help with your billing issue" scores zero ROUGE against a reference that says "Your account will be credited within 3-5 business days" — even though one is useless and one is correct. GPT-4 catches this.

**Why LoRA r=16 vs r=64?** Higher rank means more parameters updated — in theory more capacity, but also higher risk of overfitting on a small dataset. The comparison tells you whether the extra parameters help or hurt on this specific task.

**Why stratified splits?** Without stratification, some intents (especially rare ones) may not appear in the test set at all, making your evaluation miss entire failure modes.
